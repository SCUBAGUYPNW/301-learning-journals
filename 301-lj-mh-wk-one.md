Learning Journal for: Mitch Hall

This was the first week of the 301 class. There are a few differences from 201. More pair programing, and now we have additional assignments on a site called Code Wars.

Code Wars
Did three assignments on the Code Wars site.
Replace all dots
My head is at the wrong end
Abbreviate a two word name

Replace all dots was fairly straight forward, we just ran a search and replace to find all the dots in a string and replace those dots with dashes. 

My head is at the wrong end was again, some fairly straight forward code. Just a one word built in function to reverse the order of an array.

Abbreviate a two word name was a little trickier than the other two, but I was able to find working code with a little web sleuthing. Not sure exactly why one section works though. 

The code is: let firstLetters = name.split(' ').map(function (s) { return s.charAt(0); }).join('.');
That dot after join adds a dot between the two initials pulled out by the rest of this line, but I am not sure why it works to add a dot between the two letters.
